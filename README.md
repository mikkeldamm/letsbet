### Letsbet App

**[Currently working on a new branch for updating to Nativescript 3.0 and Angular 4.0.2]** [link](https://github.com/mikkeldamm/letsbet/pull/1)

#### Setup
Run `tns prepare ios`  
Run `tns build ios`

If it doesn't work, then try to remove the ios platform:  
`tns platform remove ios`  
And then add it again:  
`tns platform add ios`  

#### Run development 
Run `tns run ios` - will run in emulator if no device is connected
